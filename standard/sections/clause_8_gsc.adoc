== Cataloguing considerations

In addition to documenting and describing WIGOS metadata holdings, WMDR station metadata will be
searchable via the WIGOS Global Station Catalogue (GSC).  As part of discovery and search
workflow, a GSC may choose to apply filters to help narrow search results.  This is realized by
the API of the GSC, as well as applying facets in the catalogue.

=== Faceting

The API of the GSC, in addition to allowing for spatial/temporal/attribute queries and filters,
may choose to apply facets to WMDRs.  Facets are effective when applied against controlled
vocabularies and classifications.
